In support of my [2017 tech trends](https://aaroneaton.blog/wp/2017/01/tech-trends-2017/)&nbsp;I've done my best to look away from screens and create more with my hands. Cooking is one of the ultimate creative outlets. It's conjuring something (hopefully) amazing from basic ingredients and feeding your family in the process. Better yet, you know what you're putting into your body. Not that I worry about eating organic or not enjoy the occasional patty melt from Whataburger.

You can play the home version! Get a hunk of beef, throw some herbs and spices on it, cut up an onion, cover and put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 3 hours. Don't look at it. Trust the oven. That's called a pot roast. And it doesn't get much easier than that.

Still want easier? Fine. Get a cold pan on the stove. Lay out thick-cut bacon. Turn the stove on low. Flip the bacon every couple of minutes turning up the stove a bit each time. 15 minutes later you have perfectly cooked bacon.

Now get in the kitchen!
