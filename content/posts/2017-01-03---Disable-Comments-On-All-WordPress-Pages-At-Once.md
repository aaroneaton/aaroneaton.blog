Comments on pages by default. Not sure why that is a thing but we're talking about 13 year old software here. It's easy enough to turn off comments manually. Page by page. Why do work by hand when you could automate it?

Turns out it's simple enough to turn off comments on every single page on your site with a couple of lines of code. You can add this to your theme's functions.php file, your [core functionality plugin](http://www.billerickson.net/core-functionality-plugin/) or wherever else you deem fit.
