We all face challenges in our daily lives. The difference between those who go to sleep feeling fulfilled and those who don't is the former group makesÂ the choice to push through the challenge. In a word: Grit.

Yeah, you were up all night with your kid who was vomiting every hour. The next day was filled with chores and assorted tasks that needed to get done. Grit is sucking it up and checking off your to-do list. Having an amazing spouseÂ helps. ðŸ™‚

Your mind is dead from the long day. It would feel so good just to go to sleep. Grit is sticking to the promises you made to yourself in the evening.

Just get it done.
