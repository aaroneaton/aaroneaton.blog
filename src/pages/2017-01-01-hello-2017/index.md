It's 2017.

I have no clue if this year will be better than the last. What I do know is my reaction to events has the greatest impact on my experience.

Should I get happy or angry?

Should I mope or celebrate?

That is for me to decide.

I will work to differentiate between those things I can change and those I can't. I will seek the things that make me happy. I will celebrate the things worth celebrating. I can change my future and have an influence on my family's. What will it be?

It's 2017. This could be the best year yet.
