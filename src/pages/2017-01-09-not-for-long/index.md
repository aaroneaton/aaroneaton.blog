So many of us (developers) suffer from an extreme form of hubris.

My programming language of choice is the "right" one.
  
My chosen framework is infinitely better than the one you use.
  
My build process runs circles around yours.
  
My IDE makes yours look like a child's toy.

How many times have you looked at a project of yours from a year ago and thought, "Hey! I was a genius back then!"? More than likely you think your code was crap and you made some really terrible decisions. Those decisions, though, were the "right" ones at the time. They got the job done and you shipped something.

In web development being "right", if even attainable, is only a temporary state.
