There's an old saying, "Make hay while the sun shines". It means you should get your work done while the conditions are favorable. No distractions. Don&#8217;t even _think_ of dilly-dallying!

You never know when the power will go out. Or you'll get the flu. Or your kid will get sick. Or all of the above.

So make your hay, develop that app, write your comment or so your work while the sun is still shining.
